# The Heuraduct: A DevSecOps Pipeline for Secure CI/CD Workflows

The Heuraduct is a cutting-edge DevSecOps pipeline that integrates security, compliance, and monitoring directly into the CI/CD process. Designed for scalability across industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, The Heuraduct enables teams to automate critical security checks and enforce compliance while maintaining a seamless development experience.

## Features
- **Automated Code and Dependency Scanning**: Uses tools like **SonarQube** and **Aqua Security** to detect vulnerabilities early.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security**: Ensures secure infrastructure with **Terraform** scanned by **Checkov**.
- **Compliance and Documentation**: Integrates with **Jira** and **Confluence** to track compliance tasks and approvals.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time log analysis with **Splunk** to detect and respond to security incidents.
- **Secrets Management**: Manages sensitive credentials securely with **HashiCorp Vault**.
- **Container Security**: Scans container images and runtime behavior using **Aqua Security** and **Falco**.
- **Web Application Security**: Conducts vulnerability assessments with **OWASP ZAP**.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Implements secure data access and management with centralized encryption tools.

## Tools Used
- **CI/CD Orchestration**: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD
- **Code Quality & Security**: SonarQube, OWASP ZAP
- **Container Security**: Aqua Security, Falco
- **Infrastructure Management**: Terraform, Checkov
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Splunk
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault
- **Documentation and Compliance**: Jira, Confluence

## Pipeline Overview
1. **Build**: Automates code compilation and container image creation.
2. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyzes code for vulnerabilities with tools like SonarQube.
3. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Simulates attacks using OWASP ZAP to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
4. **Compliance Checks**: Ensures regulatory and internal compliance via Jira-integrated workflows.
5. **Infrastructure Security**: Validates IaC templates with Checkov and ensures secure deployments.
6. **Monitoring & Alerts**: Aggregates logs with Splunk for real-time monitoring and incident detection.
